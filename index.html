        <h2>Presentation Neglect</h2>
        <p>Presentations are often thrown together with hopes that subject matter knowledge and a smile will pull it off in the moment. These underwhelm, failing to win over unique audiences. There’s too much at stake–credibility, expertise, brand perception, funding–to leave such an essential communication and sales opportunity to chance.</p>

        <h2>A Reflection Of You</h2>
        <p>Presentations are part of an overall brand experience. They’re an additional touchpoint for fans and potential fans to interact and connect with your brand on a more personable level. Great work does not speak for itself, and presentations are key to winning support and respect through genuine, hard-earned connections.</p>

        <h2>Say It And Show It</h2>
        <p>Make sure the audience can see what you’re saying by giving your words impactful visuals. Supportive graphics are essential for retaining attention, fostering understanding, and remembering. Graphics also engage the audience through emotion and are another outlet for adding your personality into your work.</p>
